;; in some tests an error is unexpected but if the error does not use ;/ and only uses ;=>nil
;; then the test framework cannot distinguish between an expected error and an unexpected error.
;; So we add this line to make sure that there is at least one expected error in this test file.
(throw "hello")
;/"hello"
